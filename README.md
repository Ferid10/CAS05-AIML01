Project Title
AI-Powered Customer Support Chatbot for E-Commerce

Team
Team ID: CAS05  
Problem Statement ID: AIML01

Tech Stack
- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries/Frameworks: TensorFlow / PyTorch, Flask
- AI Models/Tools: Gemini API (or any other AI model API)

Background
Since there are a large number of e-commerce websites right now,we are aiming to create a chatbot which can help the consumer with their needs such as product recomendations and helping them with the oders

Goals
- Create a base AI model capable of answering standard customer queries related to e-commerce.
- Develop an AI chatbot that uses the Gemini 2.0 flash to answer more complex or out-of-scope questions.
- Integrate the AI model into a Flask web application, allowing customers to interact with the chatbot in real-time.

Requirements
- Functionality: The chatbot should support multiple use cases, such as answering FAQs, tracking orders, and providing product recommendations.
- Integration: The chatbot should be integrated with Gemini 2.0 flash (or any other relevant AI API) for answering queries beyond the predefined scope.
- Usability: The chatbot should have an intuitive and user-friendly interface.

Approach
1. Base AI Model: Initially, we will develop a base AI model using TensorFlow or PyTorch that can handle common customer queries related to product details, order status, shipping policies, etc.
   
2. Integration with Gemini API: To extend the chatbot's capability and handle queries beyond the scope of the base model, we will integrate the Gemini API (or any other AI model API) to dynamically answer more complex customer queries.

3. Web Interface: Using Flask, we will build a simple web application where customers can interact with the chatbot. The chatbot will be able to process the input, query the base AI model, and call the Gemini API for more advanced responses.

Expected Outcomes
- A fully functional AI-powered chatbot integrated with Flask that can answer basic customer queries.
- A chatbot that utilizes the OpenAI API for answering complex or out-of-scope questions.
- A scalable and efficient system capable of handling a high volume of customer queries.

Conclusion
This project aims to revolutionize customer support in e-commerce by leveraging AI to provide instant and accurate responses to customers. The combination of a base AI model and OpenAI API will allow the chatbot to handle a wide range of queries, ensuring that customers receive prompt and relevant information at all times.
